Think of it like a point of no return.\n\n**If our Sun were to magically be replaced by a black hole of the *same mass*, the Earth's orbit wouldn't change.** We would still orbit the black hole in the same path we currently orbit the Sun. We would freeze and be in darkness, of course, but our orbital path wouldn't be affected because the gravitational pull at our distance would be the same.\n\nThe \"sucking up everything\" image really only applies to matter that gets *very, very close* to the event horizon. Outside of that, the black hole's gravity behaves just like the gravity of any other object of equivalent mass.\n\nSo, black holes are more like extremely dense and powerful gravitational anchors rather than cosmic vacuum cleaners.

However, beneath the veneer of gleaming offices and well-compensated employees lies a complex web of pressures, expectations, and demands that contribute significantly to the pervasive stress experienced by many individuals navigating the corporate landscape. This essay will explore the multifaceted nature of stress in modern corporate life, analyzing its sources, impacts, and potential strategies for mitigation.\n\nOne of the primary drivers of corporate stress stems from the relentless pursuit of productivity and profitability. The pressure to meet increasingly ambitious targets, often fueled by shareholder demands and competitive market forces, trickles down the organizational hierarchy, impacting individuals at all levels. This pressure manifests as long working hours, an expectation of constant availability via email and other communication channels, and a pervasive feeling of never being \"caught up.\" The rise of

Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the tempest brewing within him. Below, a swarm of tiny humans scurried like panicked ants. This… this wasn’t living. This was existing.\n\nHe'd climbed the corporate ladder faster than a squirrel up an oak tree. Regional Manager of Nuzzle & Purr Marketing at only five years old (a veritable kitten in the human world!), Bartholomew was respected, feared, and swimming in salmon-flavored kibble. Yet, every quarterly report, every power lunch (fish-shaped of course), felt like a hollow victory. His days were filled with presentations on increasing the chew-toy acquisition rate, brainstorming the latest pheromone spray ad campaign, and mediating squabbles between the head of catnip and the head of laser pointers.\n\n\"Mr. Buttonsby?\" His assistant, a nervous Persian named Penelope, timidly entered. \"Mr. Whiskerton wants to see you regarding the latest squeaky mouse shipment figures.\"\n\nBartholomew felt a primal growl rumble in his chest. Not this. Not anymore.\n\n\"Penelope,\" he said, his voice low and decisive, \"Tell Mr. Whiskerton I've resigned. Effective immediately.\"\n\nPenelope nearly fainted, scattering hairballs of disbelief. \"Resigned?! But… but what will you do?\"\n\n\"I'm going to find peace,\" Bartholomew declared, unsnapping his tie with a flourish. He yanked off his tiny spectacles and placed them neatly on his desk, next to his 'World's Best Boss' mug. \"I'm going to the mountains.\"\n\nThe ensuing chaos was legendary. Whispers flew, meetings were canceled, and Mr. Whiskerton himself nearly swallowed his toupee. Bartholomew, however, was immune. He packed a small backpack with essentials: a cozy blanket, a well-loved toy mouse named Reginald, and a hefty stash of dried tuna. He hailed a taxi (a yellow one, for extra symbolism), and directed the bewildered driver towards the foothills.\n\nHe bought a tiny, rustic cabin nestled in a valley bathed in perpetual sunshine. The air smelled of pine and damp earth, a far cry from the sterile, air-conditioned reek of the city. His neighbours consisted of friendly squirrels, inquisitive deer, and a grumpy old owl named Professor Hoot.\n\nHis days were a far cry from the relentless grind. He woke up with the sun, stretched luxuriously, and ambled outside to survey his kingdom. He chased butterflies, napped in sunbeams, and meticulously stalked imaginary prey in the long grass. He even befriended a colony of ladybugs who took up residence on his windowsill.\n\nThe initial shockwaves of his abrupt departure faded. He stopped receiving urgent emails and frantic phone calls. Penelope even sent him a postcard of a particularly fetching cat bed she’d seen advertised.\n\nHe missed the camaraderie sometimes, the thrill of closing a big deal. But then he’d feel the cool mountain breeze on his fur, hear the babbling brook that ran behind his cabin, and know he'd made the right choice.\n\nOne crisp autumn afternoon, Professor Hoot hooted softly from his perch on the chimney. \"Bartholomew,\" he croaked, \"Heard you were quite the titan of industry back in the city.\"\n\nBartholomew chuckled, settling deeper into his rocking chair. \"I was, Professor. I was. But sometimes,\" he paused, watching a robin flit amongst the falling leaves, \"the greatest deal of all is finding yourself.\"\n\nHe reached out a paw, carefully adjusted his purrfectly unbuttoned vest (abandoning the tie completely). Then, he closed his eyes, let the warm sun kiss his fur, and drifted off to sleep, Reginald clutched safely in his arms. Bartholomew Buttonsby III, former corporate cat extraordinaire, was finally, and truly, at peace. He had traded a life of catnip politics for a life of pure, unadulterated feline contentment, and he wouldn’t have it any other way. He was, quite simply, the purrfect picture of retirement.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Prompting","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### Zero shot prompt","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n    temperature=0.1,\n    top_p=1,\n    max_output_tokens=5\n)\n\nzero_shot_prompt = \"\"\"Classify movie reviews as POSITIVE, NEUTRAL or NEGATIVE.\nReview: \"Her\" is a disturbing study revealing the direction\nhumanity is headed if AI is allowed to keep evolving,\nunchecked.

Instead of having to constantly run `git status`, the important information is always visible in your prompt.
