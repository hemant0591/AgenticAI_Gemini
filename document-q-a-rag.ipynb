Under the pull of gravity, small fluctuations in density cause certain pockets within the cloud to collapse inward. As these clumps condense, gravitational potential energy is converted into heat, forming a dense, hot core surrounded by an accretion disk. When the core temperature rises above about ten million Kelvin, hydrogen nuclei begin to fuse into helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy. This marks the star’s ignition—a delicate balance is achieved between the outward pressure from nuclear fusion and the inward force of gravity. Massive protostars, often more than eight times the mass of the Sun, form quickly—within a few hundred thousand years—and their intense radiation and stellar winds blow away surrounding gas, halting further accretion. These young giants illuminate nearby gas clouds, creating the glowing stellar nurseries we observe as nebulae.\\n'],\n 'uris': None,\n 'data': None,\n 'metadatas': [None],\n 'included': [<IncludeEnum.embeddings: 'embeddings'>,\n  <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>,\n  <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Retrieval: Find relevant documents","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Switch to query mode when generating embeddings.\nembed_fn.document_mode = False\n\nquery = \"How does a heavy start burn its fuel?\"\n\nresult = db.query(query_texts=[query], n_results=1)\n[all_passages] = result[\"documents\"]\n\nMarkdown(all_passages[0])","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2026-02-03T13:06:54.798425Z","iopub.execute_input":"2026-02-03T13:06:54.798752Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-02-03T13:06:55.084884Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2026-02-03T13:06:54.798718Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-02-03T13:06:55.083742Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Failed to send telemetry event CollectionQueryEvent: capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given\n","output_type":"stream"},{"execution_count":12,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"\nOnce stable, a massive star spends millions of years in its main sequence phase, burning hydrogen into helium through the CNO (carbon–nitrogen–oxygen) cycle, a fusion process much faster than the proton–proton chain that powers smaller stars like the Sun. Because of their enormous mass and gravitational pressure, core temperatures in massive stars are extremely high, causing them to burn fuel at an astonishing rate—millions of times faster than smaller stars. As hydrogen in the core becomes depleted, fusion continues in concentric shells around the core while the core itself contracts and heats further. This triggers successive stages of fusion: helium into carbon and oxygen, carbon into neon, neon into magnesium and silicon, and eventually silicon into iron. Each stage happens faster than the last—helium burning may last hundreds of thousands of years, but silicon burning can last only a few days.

If the passage is irrelevant to the answer, you may ignore it.\n\nQUESTION: How does a heavy start burn its fuel?\nPASSAGE:  Once stable, a massive star spends millions of years in its main sequence phase, burning hydrogen into helium through the CNO (carbon–nitrogen–oxygen) cycle, a fusion process much faster than the proton–proton chain that powers smaller stars like the Sun. Because of their enormous mass and gravitational pressure, core temperatures in massive stars are extremely high, causing them to burn fuel at an astonishing rate—millions of times faster than smaller stars. As hydrogen in the core becomes depleted, fusion continues in concentric shells around the core while the core itself contracts and heats further. This triggers successive stages of fusion: helium into carbon and oxygen, carbon into neon, neon into magnesium and silicon, and eventually silicon into iron. Each stage happens faster than the last—helium burning may last hundreds of thousands of years, but silicon burning can last only a few days. The star’s structure becomes layered like an onion, with each shell fusing a heavier element than the one above it, sustaining equilibrium until the fuel is finally exhausted. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"code","source":"answer = client.models.generate_content(\n    model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n    contents=prompt)\n\nMarkdown(answer.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2026-02-03T13:07:07.729387Z","iopub.execute_input":"2026-02-03T13:07:07.730375Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-02-03T13:07:08.881722Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2026-02-03T13:07:07.730342Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-02-03T13:07:08.880744Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":14,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"A massive star burns its hydrogen into helium through a process called the CNO cycle, which is way faster than the proton-proton chain that smaller stars use.
